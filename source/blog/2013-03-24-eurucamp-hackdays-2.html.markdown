eurucamp is more than a conference(&trade;). It is a community event, happening in and around Berlin, organized around a conference. To reinforce this, we started running a number of hackdays, starting with the first event on 2nd & 3rd February. This is our official program for our next one on April 6 and 7. The follow-up event, eurucamp hackdays 2, will take place in [co.up](http://co-up.de/events.html) again. You can see our full event history [here](https://tito.io/eurucamp/). Read more for details.

## Bring your own code

The theme of eurucamp hackdays 2 is "Bring your own code". We'd like to encourage you to show off what you do or help others at what they do. This can work spontanously, or you can just drop us a [line](mailto:flo@andersground.net) beforehand so that we can collect a list of possible projects to work on. We don't care about the nature of your project, big or small - feel free to suggest what you like.

## Location

As the last hackdays, eurucamp hackdays 2 will take place at [co.up](http://co-up.de). The event will take place on `April 6 and 7`. You can drop by at any time after `9:00` in the morning on both days, doors will be open by then. The event is open-ended. Try to contact one of the organizers beforehand if you want to come in late at night.
