Other then eurucamp 2012, eurucamp 2013 will be far more then a conference: it will be a week of Ruby goodness in Berlin. To pull that off, we changed our organization structure and will reintroduce some of the interesting ideas from last year to widen the reach of the camp.

## Organizational Changes

As last year, eurucamp 2013 will be run by the [Ruby Berlin e.V.](http://rubyberlin.org/). In contrast to last year, the Ruby Berlin e.V. is now an accredited non-profit organization, meaning that we can accept [tax-exempt donations](http://www.betterplace.org/de/organisations/ruby-berlin)! You are very welcome to do so and will receive proper donation receipts. All profits will be invested to improve our projects, like eurucamp, RailsGirls and the rug_b user group.

## eurucamp and jrubyconf.eu

As last year, eurucamp and jrubyconf.eu will be co-hosted events taking place in the same week in Berlin. This year, however, jrubyconf.eu will be its own, two day event happening before the conference! Similar to last year, the events will be connected and organized by the same crew. As the conferences are organized from the same budget, all sponsor aggreements will cover both events.

JRubyConf.eu will take place on August 14.-15. and eurucamp from August 16.-18.

## Cost-covering tickets

Last year, we made the mistake that tickets did not cover all running costs of the conference, especially per-person meal costs. This meant that we had to use a substantial amount of sponsor money to cover up the remaining costs, drawing funds from other important things like taping the talks. We'd like to avoid this situation this year. This means that this years prices for the tickets will rise somewhat, but not in an uncontrolled fashion. We will, however, attempt to keep the prices of student tickets low.

## Engineering Serendipity

A lot of the flair of eurucamp came from the activities. A lot of awesome things happened spontanously and somehow by chance. Last year, we had an app for that: the [activities page](http://activities.eurucamp.org/). Attendees could plan and events and get-togethers spontanously and sign up for them. This year, we are going to expand on the concept and provide the app early before the conference - we intend to provide a central spot for us and others to organize their days in Berlin. This is crucial for the last, major change:

## eurucamp week

This years event will span a week: eurucamp week will consist of:

* 4 days of impromptu get-togethers (Saturday to Tuesday), moderated by the team and run through the activities app
* 2 days of jrubyconf.eu (Wednesday and Thursday)
* 1 more relaxed day of hacking and a RailsGirls special course out by the lake (Friday)
* 2 days of the main eurucamp conference (Saturday and Sunday)

The impromptu get-togethers will be organized through the activities app. We will find an initial seed of things to do in Berlin ahead of time - as we found out last time, the tech community will fill in the blanks :).
