eurucamp 2013 will take place again from on August 16.-18. at Hotel Müggelsee. As last year, it will consist of 1 day of workshops an a weekend of talks and activites around and on Lake Müggelsee. We'd like to invite everyone to join us for 3 days of code and discussions about Ruby and Technology. Contrary to last year, [JRubyConf.eu](http://jrubyconf.eu) will not be a track of eurucamp - it will happen as a full conference just before eurucamp, on August 14. and 15.

## Tickets

eurucamp 2013 tickets will go on sale this week. Follow this [blog](http://blog.eurucamp.org) or our [Twitter](http://twitter.com/eurucamp) and [App.net](http://app.net/eurucamp) streams for updates on the exact dates. A limited number of early bird tickets will go on sale for 99 Euros.

Tickets will be a bit more expensive this year, as we want to cover more of our expenses with ticket sales. [TODO: link to detailed explanation]().

## Call for papers

The CFP process is described [TODO: here](). We will follow a half-blind process similar to [jsconf.eu](http://jsconf.eu), which is explained in detail [here TODO: link to explanation blog post]. Most talk slots are available through the CFP process. Beginners and first-time speakers are very welcome to take the stage.
