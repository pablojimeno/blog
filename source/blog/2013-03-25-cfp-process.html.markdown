A lot of conferences started experimenting with their CFP process during the recent time. Last year, we had a fairly standard, closed CFP process. We will have a closed process again this year, adopted from [jsconf.eu](http://jsconf.eu). The details of our CFP process can be found [TODO: here](). This post explains our goals and takes a look at some other processes.

## Our Goal: A diverse conference

"diverse" is en vogue at the moment, but no one seems to care to define what their focus is. Diversity comes in many shapes and colors (ha!), so I'd like to define our way of thinking about it. We'd like to have a selection process that is:

* not biased by properties like gender, race or nationality
* allows newcomers and community veterans alike
* encourages unusual topics and "ready-to-use" talks alike
* encourages unusual talk formats
* encourages people that would otherwise not submit

We are aware that this is idealistic, but we'd like to get enable this as good as we can get.

## Not Our Goal: A token conference

We don't want to split our slots with strict rules. There is no "beginner" slot. There is also no "female" slot. There are only blank slots to be filled with an interesting mix. We do, however, believe our community has enough to offer to fulfill this vision of the conference without compromising.

eurucamp is still a curated conference and building a coherent and useful body of talks is still the main concern of the conference.

## Ruled-out CFP styles

CFP via pull requests got rather popular lately. We are very (outspoken against them)[http://www.asquera.de/blog/2012-08-22/hip-but-flawed]. We believe that this form of CFP (or any form of public voting) disencourages speakers that are not sure of their proposal and biases towards seasoned speakers or popular community members. While those shouldn't be missed, they will likely submit anyways.

Another move we see lately is to have a CFP for a very limited number of slots, with all other slots filled by invited speakers. The extreme form is no CFP at all ("speakers are being cherry-picked based on their exceptional work and ideas."). We think that the promised value of this attempts - a more controlled talk list of seasoned veterans - is a treacherous one: it completely eliminates surprises, as all speakers are usually well known.

## What our CFP process looks like

Our CFP process is modeled after the [jsconf.eu](https://jsconf.eu) process and is similar to the one that we (silently) ran last year. Its a two-step process: it consists of an anonymous phase, in which all proposals are rated without speaker information. In a second phase, we de-anonymize the proposals and rate them again. After that, we try to fit them into a coherent program. This might mean that good proposals will be thrown out because they don't fit this years program.

No process is unbiased, but we feel that the jsconf process shits biases towards _a good program_ above all.

## Encouragement

This leaves one problem unsolved: we can never rate unsubmitted talks. This is why we have to methods of encouragement: speaker coaching and nominations. The first one is adopted from jsconf.eu again. We provide an open ear for those that want to submit but are not sure of whether they can pull a talk through.  Along with that, we will provide slidedecks for those that don't feel like they can build a proper presentations in time. 

Another form of encouragement are nominations: in our CFP app, you will find a button "Nominate", where you can send a short notice to someone that you think has an interesting topic. Encourage them to speak about it! Be aware that Nominations are not instantanious, as we review them, to avoid spamming if significant community members.
