Dear Ruby Enthusiasts,

as a warm-up for the eurucamp Week 2013, our sponsor [Infopark](http://www.infopark.com/) is hosting [Cloud Developer Camps](http://www.infopark.com/clouddevcamp) in June and July - one-day-events from Ruby Developers for Ruby developers.

These events are for free and concentrate on concepts for developing, deploying and running personalised and scalable websites in the cloud based on Ruby on Rails.

At the camp, developers will get together in a relaxed surrounding and both listen to talks about cloud-based web-development as well as develop Ruby code together. Together with coaches and other professionals, you can broaden your cloud- and Ruby know-how hands-on.

### Highlights

* Only the real tech stuff - no marketing, no sales, no HR
* Talks, workshops and lightning talks about Rails development in the cloud
* Learn about cool tools for developing websites in the cloud based on Ruby on Rails
* Networking, hacking, table football, barbecue and chilling

### Speakers (amongst others)

* Organizer of the eurucamp and CEO of asquera, Florian Gilcher
* Steffen Krause and Constantin Gonzalez of Amazon Web Services
* Nicolai Longolius, CEO of schnee von morgen webTV
* Thomas Witt of Infopark

And again, it's all free. Breakfast, Lunch, Bratwurst, Beer and everything else is on Infopark.

So, why does Infopark sponsor these events? Well, Infopark is a Cloud CMS & CRM platform for developing professional web-sites using Ruby on Rails. We'd like to to help establishing and expanding the Ruby cloud community. So these Camps will be all about professional web development in the cloud.
